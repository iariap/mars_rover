This is my solution for the mars rover challenge.

Given matrix size and a series of commands, answer the robot's position checking boundaries.
For example:
```
matrix_size = 4
commands = RIGHT, UP, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN
```
Will consider this matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3
    4   5   6   7
    8   9   10  11
    12  13  14  15
```
In this case should return 12
